## Setup Guide

For setup instructions go [here](./docs/setup_en.md).

## What does randomization do to this game?

In Metroid Prime all of the suit upgrades and powerups are shuffled into the multiworld. This means you will have to think of creative and non standard ways in order to accomplish your goal.

## What is the goal of Metroid Prime when randomized?

The goal of randomized Metroid Prime depends on your selected victory condition. The current options allow you to specify a required number of artifacts and then whether you want to count beating Ridley, or both Ridley and Metroid Prime as the victory condition.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

All suit upgrades except the following can be found in another player's world:
- Power Suit
- Power Beam
- Combat Visor
- Scan Visor

## What does another world's item look like in Metroid Prime?

Multiworld items appear as a Metroid Trophy in the game.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The player will immediately have their suit inventory updated and receive a notification in the Client.
* __Currently there is no in-game HUD notification for this, although this is actively being worked on__

## FAQs
- What happens if I pickup an item without having the client running?

  - In order for Metroid Prime Archipelago to function correctly, the Client should always be running whenever you are playing through your game. Due to the way location checks are handled, the client will not be aware of any item you have picked up when it is not running except the one you most recently picked up.

- Does this work with PrimeHack or the Widescreen Hack?

  - It hasn't been tested extensively, but so far it appears yes
